##### DFS #####
TC: V^2

Problems: ToDo
Connected Components Problem in Matrix
Number of Enclaves [flood fill implementation - multisource]

Points:




##### BFS #####
TC: O(V+E)

Points:
If Distance is 1 between nodes, BFS could be used for shortest Distance


Task:
Check Why DFS is not used for O1 BFS Problem



Note: take care of index n,m it should be n-1, m-1;


###### Dijkstra Algorithm: #########

Points:
Does'nt work if the graph has -ve edge or -ve cycle
From prioity, if the node is seen first time, its it shortest distance, don't reexplore

Why PQ and not Queue ?
Ans: you myt end up exploring the path which are not even shortest

Queue could be used in case of uniform distance, or even BFS could be used


###### BellmanFord ###########
TC: V*E
Single Source Shortest Path

Points: 
Relaxation should have achived by N-1, if not graph contains a -ve cycle;
In disconnected graph, relaxation should not be performed from edge having INF dist;
 


###### Minimum Spanning Tree #######

$$$$$ Prims Algo $$$$$

Step1: Take any node, push it with parent as -1 in PQ
Step2: Peek from PQ, and explore the adjacent node

Since we always add lowest weight neight to MSt, whateven node comes out PQ
will obey this role, mark it as isVisited, and never visit again.
Step3: Explore all the neigbour and populate again the PQ



Notes: use pq as weight, node, parent is MST is required, else weight,node is enough;

$$$$$ Kruskal Algo $$$$$

Points:  Most Stones Removed with Same Row or Column
Column could be considered as:
col = row + col, giving all col a single entity, and row are also single entity

Coordinate x,y is in code is col, row
