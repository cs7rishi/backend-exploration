Hey, guys, welcome back.

In this lecture, we are going to talk about in memory streams, basically about bite in Catrine and

bite output's glasses.

So just like we have fine in poetry and Frylock poetry as the concrete implementations to read and write

for science.

And just as I said, that we have different concrete implementations of input stream and output stream,

depending upon the type of source and destination to read from or to write to an internal or in-memory

byte array.
