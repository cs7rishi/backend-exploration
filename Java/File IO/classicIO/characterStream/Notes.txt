####  Character Stream  ####
Scores of character stream is a stream of characters.

In Java 1.1 introduced to character stream and read/write data.

Now, you would be thinking
 then how we were reading writing text data before Jared 1.01.

We have few method in the Java IO, for this conversion, but method
did'nt account for character encodings.
Character Encoding is one of the main reason for character stream.
Like InputStream/Output Stream, we have Reader and Writer for character streams

##### Charset and Character Encoding ######

$$$$ Charset $$$$
Charset: Set of character and symbols used by 1 or more language
>Then that character set has allocated 100 numbers to represent
 those characters, those hundred characters
>We have so many cassettes available now,
 ASCII character set covers, letters and symbols, mainly for
 English text.

>Then we have many extended ASCII sets.
 What these does?
 $ They include all the code points from asking for
 compatibility with ASCII and then adds more letters
 and symbols to represent some other languages.

 $ And now the most latest one Unicode character set that
 contains characters for most of the living languages
 and scripts in the world.

$$$ Encoding $$$
> Encoding is the way these characters are stored in memory.
> ASCII is character set, as well as encoding
> ASCII uses 8 bytes to saves, which is 2^7
> Character set has there own encoding rule
> Unicode is Universal coded character set.
  $ Unicode uses well know encoding, UTF-32, UTF-16, UTF-8
  $ How UTF-8 works
   / If it reads 1st byte as 0, it treat it as ASCII Encoding
   / If it reads 1st byte as 1, read all continuous 1, meaning that bytes(8 bits) need to be read
   / if 1110 is read, then 2 bytes need to be read for encoding
